# My Vim Config

This is my vim setup. I'm not a die-hard vim user, but this is what I've found useful for server installs and quick editing.

### Installing

1. clone repo to ~/.dotvim
2. cd ~/.dotvim
3. update submodules
4. make install

### Plugins

All the plugins are listed in `vimrc.bundles` and are handled by `vundler`
